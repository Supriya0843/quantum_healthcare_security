# Quantum Enhanced Security for Heathcare Systems

“Quantum Enhanced Security for Healthcare Systems” is designed to protect sensitive medical data like patient records, prescriptions, and hospital reports from cyberattacks. 

As quantum computers become more advanced, traditional encryption methods such as RSA and ECC may no longer be safe. To solve this problem, the project uses Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) to make healthcare systems secure against both current and future quantum threats. 
The QKD (BB84 protocol) is implemented using IBM’s Qiskit AER simulator to generate safe encryption keys and detect eavesdropping.
At the same time, PQC algorithms like Kyber (for key exchange) and Dilithium (for digital signatures) provide strong protection for data and user authentication.
